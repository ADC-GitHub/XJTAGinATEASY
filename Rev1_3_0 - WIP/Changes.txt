Rev 1.0.0

Initial release

Rev 1.1.0

General clean up from early 1.1.0 release
Code added to debug XJTAG issue with aborting early (stoptest(), runner object close and restarted), without this code 
	XJTAG would fail to run after a stoptest()
Modified text output to be fixed text length and colours on Pass/Fail text

Rev 1.2.0

Significant overhaul on operation with the need to initialise and close the runner, new runner functions added (Initialise and close).
	This was communicated by XJTAG as required or issues could occur as some variable are not cleared, only on starting 
	a new runner object.
The stoptest() debug code in 1.1.0 no longer required as overruled by above.
Modified text output to help be clear the seperation of XJTAG text (start) and ATEASY tests (end) with +++++ line
General clean up of no function comments

Rev 1.3.0
